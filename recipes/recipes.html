        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> This is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish which is 
            often reserved for very special occasions such as weddings,
             parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy 
             preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For 
             biryani, always use long grain rice. Basmati rice with 
             its thin, fine grains is the ideal variety to use. Ghee 
             is butter that has been slowly melted so that the milk 
             solids and golden liquid have been separated and can be 
             used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic 
             taste.
